# Compositionally Generalizable 3D Structure Prediction

[comment]: <> (## Introduction)
In this work, We bring in the concept of compositional generalizability and factorizes the 3D shape reconstruction problem into proper sub-problems, each of which is tackled by a carefully designed neural sub-module with generalizability guarantee. Experiments on PartNet show that we achieve superior performance than baseline methods, which validates our problem factorization and network designs.
